Hi guys!
Welcome to my Vehicles By Dome pack!

All this vehicles are made from Vanilla meshes but since those are still experimental due to the use of a not supported technique I suggest to add first the Props folder and then one vehicle at the time, see if the game run right, without crashes and performance issues, and the go on to add more.

In order to install this just unzip the file into your C:\Users\%UserName%\AppData\LocalLow\Colossal Order\Cities Skylines II\StreamingData~ folder and load the game, all of them will be spawned automatically and randomly according to their porpouse.
Some of them have also a Prop version that you can find in the Dev_Menu under "Dome/Vehicles/Props" , please don't use the other version of those vehicles since it can cause issues.
